# Master thesis
This Github is part of the master thesis by Yannick van Etten. 
This thesis investigates the extent to which national elections in the Netherlands reflect
the populationâ€™s perspectives on key political issues, focusing on the "Environment,"
"Immigration," and "Economy." The research utilises data from the Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies. A novel indicator, the issue score of an election, is developed to
quantify the presence of specific issues in election outcomes. The thesis can be read [here](https://github.com/YannickvanEtten/master_thesis/).

The first Notebook provides a detailed description of the data used in this thesis. The Notebook can be viewed [here](https://github.com/YannickvanEtten/master_thesis/).

The second Notebook performs the GLS and iGLS estimation of the model. The Notebook can be viewed [here](https://github.com/YannickvanEtten/master_thesis/).

The third Notebook illustrates the impact of different party scores on the estimation results by a robustness investigation. The Notebook can be viewed [here](https://github.com/YannickvanEtten/master_thesis/).
